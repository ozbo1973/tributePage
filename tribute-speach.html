              <p>Patrick Ryan Parkinson aka "Pitter" meant so many things to me, In many ways Pat was like an older brother to me.  Now don’t get me wrong, not the older more mature brother, we all know our Pitter could throw a tantrum like no other.  If you ever witnessed it, it was a thing of beauty.  He was like the older brother that introduced many new experiences into my life that made me a more well rounded human being.</p>

              <p>Pitter I know I didn’t get to say good bye to you.  But I'm glad I got to tell you in person on a number of occasions that I love you and when we see each other again you have to tell me all about the BW concert sneak in.</p>

              <p>One thing Pat cherished more than anything, above Music, reporting, writing, and "poking at the hornets nest"  was his friendships.   He loved his friends very much. They were his extended family.</p>

              <p>Our bro Pitter was a complex friend <br>
                In 2006 after an "epic day of boarding" as he would say,  Pat came over to my house and told me about this cool new social media website he just signed up on called Facebook.  This site was both a blessing and curse for Pat.  It allowed him to re-connect with so many of his friends.  He was able to heal some past wounds and gave him an avenue to express the many incredible and unique sides of his personality.  However as we all know social media friendships cannot replace physical friendships.   I never discussed with Pat why he recently deactivated his account but I assume that the down side of Social Media  may have gotten to him or maybe it made it too easy for his urge to stir up controversy.  For those of us that knew Pat well, we know that creating controversy was his way of entertaining himself.  Pat enjoyed uncomfortableness and playing devils advocate. </p>

              <p>Pat loved words, he was a master at using them.  There are so many words to describe Pat as friend(Generous, Edgy, odd, Kind, persistent, Agitator, energetic, fearless, talented, positive, compassionate, loud, uncompromising etc… )</p>

              <p>But The Two main words  I would use to describe friendship with pat is Loyal and Entertaining.   Once he was your friend, he was your friend for life.  It didn’t matter if you were meeting Pat for the first time or you were his friend for 30+ years, when he talked to you, it always felt you were being interviewed for a book he was writing about you.  He was genuinly interested in getting to know you on a deep level.   Pats friends knew they could talk to him whenever they needed him.  He always pointed out your good qualities and made you feel important.</p>

              <p>Whenever you hung out with Pat meant that you had better strap in because you were about to run the gauntlet of emotions. If you ever had the privilege to travel with him, you definitely know what I am talking about.  You would feel excitement, fear, compassion, embarrassment and many other emotions. I always carried bail money when I traveled with Pat,  luckily I never had to use it.  However when it was all said and done and in no matter what enviornment, Pat Parkinson always entertained you.</p>

              <p>Pat enjoyed deep conversations and laughing with his friends.  He had two distinct laughs, one was his signature machine gun out loud laugh the other was  his silent laugh with his mouth open and his whole body moving uncontrolably.   Pat was the ultimate Devils advocate, he would challenge you on many of your thoughts and beliefs. He would throw jabs and some haymakers with his words.  Sometimes you wanted to strangle him but he always knew how to mend it all back together.</p>

              <p>Pat loved to travel, he has numerous friends that expand the globe .  He was the type of person who made friends easily,  His intellegence and whit are unmatched by anyone I have ever met.  Pat would strike up conversations with random strangers and get to know them very quickly.  I always admired his ability to hold a conversation on pretty much any subject.   Pat would tell me stories from his travels and would be able to in such a descriptive way that made me feel I knew these friends of his on a deeper level.</p>

              <p>Pat loved Snowboarding with his friends, he enjoyed taking us off the normal path(which is how he lived his life).  He could gluide on a snowboard through the powder like he was floating on air.   Pat was always up for a day at the basin.  I got to ride with him frequently the past 6 years, the glow and excitement it brought to his face when he was on the slopes was like a he was experiencing it for the first time even though it was his thousandth.  There are many things I will miss about Pat but none more than watching him get excited over something he into.  He could barely contain himself.  When he was passionate about something he dove head first into it.</p>

              <p>Pat loved to share his wisdom of music and writings with his friends.  A majority of his friends music collection is filled with bands Pat introduced us to.  Pat would recommend books, comics, movies and music to us and you knew they were worth checking out .   This past year Pat created a group text with Brian, Shanze, Curt, Justin and myself where he would communicate with us almost everyday. He mostly would post quotes from authors, philosophers and song lyrics and occasionally throw a "whats up fellas" to let us know we were on his mind.</p>

              <p>Pat loved to road trip to live concerts with his friends.  Whenever there was a show he wanted to see, he would beg and plea for one of his friends to go. A couple of years ago Pats favorite band was playing in Boise, ID.  He bought my ticket and said your going dude!  The day before we were to go I wrecked snowboarding and was doped up on pain killers, I still hopped in a car and drove with Pat for 5 hrs to the concert because I knew how much it meant to him and he would have done the same for me.</p>

              <p>Pat loved talking Sports with his friends.  He didn’t love any one team or any one sport and he barely knew the rules but he would always  go against your team just to be difficult.  He loved sports because he wanted to figure out how to beat the spread.  The spread was his arch nemesis.  He was bound and determined to figure out to beat it, and if he couldn’t he would move to a different sport.</p>

              <p>Pat also loved discussing politics with his friends, I never got much into politics with him, but I know many of you had some boiling political discussions with him.  Whenever we would road trip he would turn on talk radio and listen to the likes of Sean Hanity, Glen Beck etc… I know these shows were not Pats preferred agenda but he told me you have to "know your enemy."  He always listened to both sides, which made him masterful when debating politics and in his playing the devils advocates role.  As I said before Pat loved uncomfortableness and This current presidential election was taylor made for Pitter.  We are going to miss his insightful comments during the next debate</p>

              <p>Pat is quoted on several occasions as wanting to go back to the times of the  "Porter Palace" days.  This was his paradise. It was a simpler time where he was able to get home from his Job, hang out with his bros, whether it be rock climbing, mountain biking, having passionate discussions or taking off to see a live music show and not worry about the stresses of career and adult hood.</p>

              <p>I know he loved all of his friends dearly, we all have had many different kinds of experiences with Pat, he treasured friendship as if it were the only true valuable thing on earth.  I know he had a deep love for his W.T. friends who he grew up with.  I will never forget the time I went to visit him in Pacifica Ca, We had a great time just chillin, I thought to myself wow what an awesome place to live but when he was dropping me off at the airport, as I took my bags from the trunk of his car and turned around,  Pat had huge tears in eyes and he gave me the biggest hug and said that he loved me and he missed his friends so much.</p>

              <p>I want to thank Scott, Pam, Josh and Nico for letting me speak today.  Your son was an amazing soul and even more amazing friend.</p>

              <p>I'm going to close with this.   I don’t know where we go after this life, but  I know one thing for sure that when all of us that are Pats closest friends get to where he is at, he will be waiting for us as we hop on the Gondola  to his Porter Palace on the top of the mountain, the Centra will be parked in the driveway, the music collection will be unlimited he will always have his extended family with him.</p>

              <p>I quote from a band Penny-wise, a band Pat introduced to me to and he would always send this quote to me throughout the years.</p>

              <p>"If you ever get the feeling you cant go on, just remember the side that your on… You’ve got friends with you 'til the end" <br>
              Pat we love you!!</p>
